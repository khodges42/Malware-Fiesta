# Malware Fiesta

Just a random collection of sketchy code I've written over the years. Nastiness varies from playful fun to whatever the opposite of that is. Some of these are for practical jokes, some are proofs of concept, others are for research. Mostly the first, though.

**Disclaimer:** You probably don't want to download/run anything in here unless you _explicitly_ know what you're doing. I am not liable for any damage caused. Educational use only.
